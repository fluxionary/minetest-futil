# futil - flux's utility mod

a bunch of simple lua routines and data structures. this is a library which is used by other mods, which doesn't change
any behavior or add any features itself. it mostly provides the creator (flux) w/ a toolkit for solving common problems
without having to re-implement the same code in multiple mods.
